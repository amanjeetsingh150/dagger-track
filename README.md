# ‚è∞  Dagger Track
A gradle plugin that automatically adds clock tracking for your components and subcomponents.

## Features
DaggerTrack will tell you following type of time for each of your component and subcomponent injection:

1. **Total time**: This is the total wall clock time took by the component or subcomponent injection.
2. **On CPU time**: CPU time is the time the inject method took working on cpu.
3. **Off CPU time**: Off CPU time is the time that inject method took when it was not running on the CPU which means it was 
doing some I/O work or maybe blocked on some other resource.
